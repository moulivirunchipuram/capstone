<h3>Udacity Capstone Project</h3>
<hr></hr>

In this project, we are required to work with four different datasets viz., Immigration, Airport Codes, Global Tempeature, and US Cities Demographics.  These data sets are combined to form a schema which is used to get several correlations between the datasets for the purpose of analysis and derive the trends.  For example, from which country most immigrants are arriving at the US, how long do the immigrants stay in the US on an average, which port of arrival attracts most immigrants.
